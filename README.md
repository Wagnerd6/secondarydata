# Secondary data
Bookbased mushroom data set, describing physical characteristics, binary classification in poisonous or edible. 
Data Set Description Files are reported for two data sets: Primary and Secondary.
The primary data set encodes the textbook mushroom entries, while the secondary data set is a pilot data, result of simulation.
The secondary data may be used to achieve a binary classification using the Random Forests classifier (Accuracy and F2 score of 1).
